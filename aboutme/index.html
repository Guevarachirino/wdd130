        <p>Pleasure to meet you.  I'm from El Salvador, I have been living in Virginia for almost four years. 
            I got married 4 years ago and we have a son, he is 3 years old. I love to spend time with my family, 
            read books and also dance. 
              </p>
        <p>One thing I love about BYU-Idaho is that while I'm developing university and life skills,
            my teachers help me to see how education is important in the plan that God has for everyone. 

        </p>

            I'm really greatfull to learn about web design because this carreer has advantages such as:
            a lot companies are hiring web developers and we can find a remote job. It's creative and fun
            because Web development gives us the opportunity to express ourself creatively on the internet.
        </p>
        <p>I'm happy to be in this class and I'm looking forward learning about everyone.</p>
