        The 4 types of scent that we use for our candles: on warm, woody, oriental and fresh.

          Why is it important to use a candle snuffer? Though our first impulse would be to blow out the candle, this is not the recommended process. Besides stopping the aroma quickly, it can also inundate the immediate area with smoke, notwithstanding other dangers like flammable objects nearby. Another common misconception is to turn off a candle with water. Doing this can cause the wax to change its temperature drastically, and that can cause a glass receptacle to crack or break. With that in mind, the best method would be a candle snuffer. However, most people do not have one on hand. Regardless of that, there are other similar acceptable methods that can have the same effect, such as utilizing the cap that came with the receptacle if there's one to begin with or utilizing a metal spoon. The result would be to remove the oxygen from the flame, and that would prevent the smoke or sparks from fly about.

        Tips for decorating with candles.

        As a centerpiece: If it is a very large table, you can combine several and play with different sizes. On the bedside table: Add magic to your bedroom and create a warm and intimate atmosphere by placing some candles, flowers and stones on the bedside table. Candles in the bathroom: Light your aromatic candle to take a relaxing bath and rest better at night. In the Reading Corner: Whether you are reading a book or flipping through a magazine on the sofa, in a hammock or in bed, light a candle near where you are, it will help you create a calmer and more relaxed environment that will facilitate your concentration. Combined with vases: Create a still life using other decorative objects such as vases and play with heights to give life to your rooms. A creative idea for your wedding decoration.

        Where should I place the scented candles? 
        Scented candles can help create that ideal and calm atmosphere. Place bedroom candles on a desk or dresser. If you had another location in mind, just be sure to avoid placing the candle near bedding, curtains, or clothing. It is also important to remember to never fall asleep with candles burning
      <p>
        Where should candles not be placed?
        Remember to keep candles away from drafts, high traffic areas, pets, and children. Also avoid placing lit candles near curtains, under shelves or cabinets, or on the floor. The candles must be placed on a stable and heat resistant surface.
